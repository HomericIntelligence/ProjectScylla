Review your work on issue #698 and identify any follow-up tasks,
enhancements, or edge cases discovered during implementation.

**Output format:**
Return a JSON array of follow-up items (max 5). Each item must have:

- `title`: Brief, specific title (under 70 characters)
- `body`: Detailed description of the follow-up work
- `labels`: Array of relevant labels from:
  ["enhancement", "bug", "test", "docs", "refactor", "research"]

If there are no follow-up items, return an empty array: `[]`

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Add edge case handling for empty input",
    "body": "During implementation, discovered that empty input returns
misleading error. Should add validation and specific error message.",
    "labels": ["enhancement", "bug"]
  },
  {
    "title": "Add integration tests for new feature",
    "body": "Current tests only cover unit level. Need integration tests
to verify end-to-end behavior with real GitHub API.",
    "labels": ["test"]
  }
]
```

**Guidelines:**

- Only include concrete, actionable items discovered during this implementation
- Don't include speculative future features
- Keep descriptions concise but specific enough for another developer
- Max 5 items - prioritize the most important
- Return `[]` if no follow-ups needed
