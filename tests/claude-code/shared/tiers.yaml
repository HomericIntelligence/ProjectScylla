# Tier Definitions
#
# Defines the testing tiers for the agent evaluation framework.
# Each tier represents a different level of agent capability.
#
# Tier Structure (7 tiers, ~121+ sub-tests total):
# - T0: Prompts - 24 sub-tests for system prompt ablation
# - T1: Skills - 10 sub-tests for skill category ablation
# - T2: Tooling - 15 sub-tests for tool/MCP ablation
# - T3: Delegation - 41 sub-tests for agent ablation
# - T4: Hierarchy - 14 sub-tests for orchestrator ablation (7 hierarchy + 7 agent teams)
# - T5: Hybrid - 15+ sub-tests for best combinations
# - T6: Super - 1 sub-test with everything enabled
