# Session Notes: Adding JSON Links to Reports

## Session Context

**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Branch**: skill/reporting/add-json-links-to-reports (from 154-split-tier-overview-tables)
**Initial Request**: "I want all reports to be markdown format, and then have the reports have a link to the json version of it, specifically the judge and agent results"

## Initial Exploration

### Discovery Phase

1. **Found report generation files**:
   - `src/scylla/reporting/markdown.py` - Tier-level reports (not modified)
   - `src/scylla/e2e/run_report.py` - Run-level reports (modified)
   - `tests/unit/reporting/test_markdown.py` - Tests for tier reports

2. **Explored path structure**:
   - `src/scylla/e2e/paths.py` defines directory constants:
     - `AGENT_DIR = "agent"`
     - `JUDGE_DIR = "judge"`
     - `RESULT_FILE = "result.json"`

3. **Found where JSON files are created**:
   - `src/scylla/e2e/subtest_executor.py:131-151` - Saves `agent/result.json`
   - `src/scylla/e2e/subtest_executor.py:281-300` - Saves `judge/result.json`
   - `src/scylla/e2e/llm_judge.py:980-982` - Saves `judge/judgment.json`

### File Structure Understanding

Run directory structure:
```
T0/00/run_01/
├── agent/
│   ├── result.json      # Simplified: exit_code, stdout, stderr, tokens, cost
│   ├── output.txt       # Full agent output
│   └── MODEL.md         # Agent model info
├── judge/
│   ├── result.json      # Simplified: score, passed, grade, reasoning
│   ├── judgment.json    # Full detailed judgment
│   ├── prompt.md        # Judge prompt
│   ├── response.txt     # Judge response
│   └── MODEL.md         # Judge model info
├── workspace/           # Agent's work files
├── task_prompt.md       # Task given to agent
├── report.md           # Markdown report (what we modified)
└── report.json         # JSON summary
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Understanding the Report Function

The `generate_run_report()` function in `src/scylla/e2e/run_report.py` creates markdown reports with sections:

1. Header (title, metadata)
2. Summary table (score, grade, status, cost, duration, tokens)
3. Token breakdown (if detailed stats available)
4. Task section (link to task_prompt.md)
5. **Judge Evaluation section** ← Modified here
6. Criteria scores (if available)
7. Detailed explanations
8. Workspace state (files created)
9. **Agent Output section** ← Modified here

### Step 2: Modification Points

**Original links** (single item):
```python
# Line ~162
"[View full judgment](./judge/judgment.json)",

# Line ~249
"[View agent output](./agent/output.txt)",
```

**Modified to bullet lists**:
```python
# Lines 162-163
"- [View full judgment](./judge/judgment.json)",
"- [View judge result JSON](./judge/result.json)",

# Lines 249-250
"- [View agent output](./agent/output.txt)",
"- [View agent result JSON](./agent/result.json)",
```

### Step 3: Testing Approach

**Verification script**:
```python
pixi run python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from scylla.e2e.run_report import generate_run_report

report = generate_run_report(...)

# Verify links present
assert '- [View judge result JSON](./judge/result.json)' in report
assert '- [View agent result JSON](./agent/result.json)' in report

print('✓ All JSON links are present in the report')
"
```

**Result**:
```
✓ All JSON links are present in the report

Sample report section:
============================================================
## Judge Evaluation

- [View full judgment](./judge/judgment.json)
- [View judge result JSON](./judge/result.json)

---

## Agent Output

- [View agent output](./agent/output.txt)
- [View agent result JSON](./agent/result.json)
```

### Step 4: Test Suite Verification

```bash
pixi run pytest tests/unit/reporting/test_markdown.py -v
```

**Result**: 28/28 tests passed ✅

## Technical Details

### JSON File Contents

**agent/result.json**:
```json
{
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "...",
  "token_stats": {
    "input_tokens": 1000,
    "output_tokens": 500,
    "cache_read_tokens": 200,
    "cache_creation_tokens": 50
  },
  "cost_usd": 0.15,
  "api_calls": 5
}
```

**judge/result.json**:
```json
{
  "score": 0.85,
  "passed": true,
  "grade": "B",
  "reasoning": "Good implementation with minor issues"
}
```

### Why Two Judge Files?

- `judgment.json` - Full detailed evaluation (created by `llm_judge.py`)
- `result.json` - Simplified for quick checking (created by `subtest_executor.py`)

Both are useful:
- `judgment.json` for detailed analysis
- `result.json` for programmatic pass/fail checking

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Task Tool Interruption

**Problem**: Started with Task tool exploration, user interrupted
**Resolution**: Switched to direct Glob/Grep searches
**Takeaway**: For targeted file searches in well-organized codebases, direct tools are faster

### Issue 2: Edit String Mismatch

**Problem**: First Edit call failed with "String to replace not found"
**Cause**: Didn't match exact indentation from file
**Resolution**: Read exact line range first, copy string exactly
**Takeaway**: Always Read before Edit for precise matching
