# Code Quality Audit Against Development Principles

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Date** | 2025-02-09 |
| **Objective** | Audit ProjectScylla codebase against 7 core development principles for public release readiness |
| **Outcome** | ✅ 6.3/10 rating, GO with conditions, 13 issues filed (P0-P2), comprehensive audit report created |
| **Context** | Pre-release quality assessment for ProjectScylla (~33K lines Python, 90 source files) |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this audit process when:

- **Preparing for public release** - need comprehensive quality assessment
- **Taking over legacy codebase** - understand technical debt
- **Post-rapid-development cleanup** - after sprint, assess code health
- **Setting improvement roadmap** - prioritize technical debt
- **Team onboarding** - document known issues upfront

**Don't use when**:

- Single feature development (too heavyweight)
- Already have recent audit (< 3 months old)
- Just need specific issue analysis (not full audit)

## The 7 Development Principles

### 1. KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid

**Rule**: Don't add complexity when a simpler solution works
**Red flags**:

- Functions >100 lines
- Nested conditionals >5 levels deep
- Complex logic that requires comments to understand

### 2. YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It

**Rule**: Don't add things until they are required
**Red flags**:

- Unused functions/classes
- Over-engineered abstractions
- Features built for hypothetical future needs

### 3. TDD - Test Driven Development

**Rule**: Write tests to drive implementation
**Red flags**:

- Modules with 0% test coverage
- Code without corresponding tests
- Tests written after implementation (acceptable but suboptimal)

### 4. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

**Rule**: Don't duplicate functionality, data structures, or algorithms
**Red flags**:

- Copy-paste code across files
- Same logic in >2 places
- Repeated patterns not extracted

### 5. SOLID Principles

**Rules**:

- **S**ingle Responsibility - one class, one purpose
- **O**pen-Closed - open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution - subtypes must be substitutable
- **I**nterface Segregation - many specific interfaces > one general
- **D**ependency Inversion - depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Red flags**:

- God classes (>500 lines, many responsibilities)
- Classes that do everything
- Tight coupling between modules

### 6. Modularity

**Rule**: Develop independent modules through well-defined interfaces
**Red flags**:

- Circular dependencies
- Modules that can't be tested independently
- No clear separation of concerns

### 7. POLA - Principle of Least Astonishment

**Rule**: Create intuitive and predictable interfaces
**Red flags**:

- Surprising behavior
- Inconsistent naming
- Unclear error messages

## Verified Workflow

### Phase 1: Codebase Statistics

Gather baseline metrics:

```bash
# Count source files
find scylla -name "*.py" | wc -l
# Output: 90 files

# Count test files
find tests -name "*.py" | wc -l
# Output: 77 files

# Count lines of code
cloc scylla/ --quiet
# Output: ~33K lines

# Check for unexpected file types
find . -name "*.mojo" | wc -l
# Output: 0 (revealed documentation inaccuracy)
```

### Phase 2: Module-by-Module Assessment

For each major module, evaluate against all 7 principles:

**Assessment Template**:

```markdown
### Module: scylla/[module-name]/
**Files**: X source files (~Y lines) | **Rating: Z/10** | **Status: GO/NO-GO**

| Principle | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| KISS | X/10 | [Specific findings] |
| YAGNI | X/10 | [Specific findings] |
| TDD | X/10 | [Specific findings] |
| DRY | X/10 | [Specific findings] |
| SOLID | X/10 | [Specific findings] |
| Modularity | X/10 | [Specific findings] |
| POLA | X/10 | [Specific findings] |

**Critical Issues**:
1. [Issue 1 - specific file:line]
2. [Issue 2 - specific file:line]
...

**Recommendation**: [GO/NO-GO with conditions]
```

**Modules to assess**:

1. Core business logic (e2e/, executor/, judge/)
2. Supporting libraries (metrics/, analysis/, reporting/)
3. Adapters and integrations (adapters/, config/)
4. Infrastructure (cli/, core/, discovery/)
5. Documentation and scripts (docs/, scripts/)

### Phase 3: Issue Prioritization

Classify findings into priority tiers:

**P0 - Blocking for Release**:

- Critical violations that confuse users immediately
- Missing tests for foundational code
- Severe DRY violations (>80% duplication)
- God classes (>2000 lines)

**P1 - High Priority**:

- Missing tests for important modules
- Large functions (>200 lines)
- Moderate duplication

**P2 - Should Address Soon**:

- Minor duplication
- Documentation issues
- TODO markers
- Deep nesting

### Phase 4: Known-Issue Comments

For issues that can't be fixed immediately, add inline documentation:

```python
"""Module docstring.

KNOWN ISSUE: [Brief description of problem]
See GitHub Issue #XXX - [Issue title]
TODO: [What needs to be done]
"""
```

**Benefits**:

- Acknowledges technical debt
- Prevents confusion
- Provides tracking reference
- Shows transparency

### Phase 5: GitHub Issue Creation

For each identified issue, create detailed GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[P0] Brief description of issue" \
  --label "P0,refactoring,tech-debt" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Objective
[What needs to be fixed]

## Problem
[Detailed description with evidence]

### Impact
- [Impact point 1]
- [Impact point 2]

## Proposed Solution
[Specific steps to fix]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Dependencies
[Any blockers]

## Risk Assessment
[Low/Medium/High with rationale]
EOF
)"
```

**Issue template sections**:

- Objective (1-2 sentences)
- Problem (with code examples/metrics)
- Proposed Solution (actionable steps)
- Success Criteria (measurable)
- Dependencies
- Risk Assessment

### Phase 6: Audit Report Generation

Create comprehensive audit document:

```markdown
# Code Quality Audit - [Date]

## Executive Summary
**Rating: X.X/10** | **Go/No-Go: GO with conditions**

[Brief summary of findings]

## Module-by-Module Assessment
[Table of all modules with ratings]

## Critical Issues (P0)
[List of blocking issues]

## Recommendations
[Prioritized action items]

## Testing Metrics
[Coverage gaps and test count]

## Appendix: GitHub Issues Filed
[Links to all filed issues]
```

**Save location**: `docs/dev/code-quality-audit-YYYY-MM.md`

## Failed Attempts

### ❌ Attempt 1: Fix Everything Immediately

**What we tried**: Decompose 2269-line god class during audit
**Why it failed**: Too risky - high chance of breaking tests, time-consuming
**Lesson**: Audit should document and track, not fix immediately. Create issues + known-issue comments instead.

### ❌ Attempt 2: Rate Each Principle Subjectively

**What we tried**: Assign scores based on "feels"
**Why it failed**: Inconsistent, hard to justify ratings
**Lesson**: Use objective metrics:

- KISS: Function length, nesting depth
- TDD: Test file count, coverage %
- DRY: Duplicate code detection
- SOLID: Class size, responsibility count

### ❌ Attempt 3: Audit Without Gathering Stats First

**What we tried**: Start assessing modules without baseline
**Why it failed**: No context for relative severity (is 500 lines large for this codebase?)
**Lesson**: Always start with statistics phase - establishes baseline

### ❌ Attempt 4: Create Issues Without Proposed Solutions

**What we tried**: File issues that just describe problems
**Why it failed**: Team doesn't know how to fix, issues languish
**Lesson**: Every issue must include proposed solution section

## Recovery from Failures

### Issue: Discovered Huge God Class

**Symptom**: File is >2000 lines with multiple responsibilities
**Don't**: Try to refactor immediately during audit
**Do**:

1. File detailed GitHub issue with decomposition plan
2. Add known-issue comment to file
3. Mark module as NO-GO* (conditional)
4. Schedule refactoring for separate session

### Issue: Found Documentation Inaccuracy

**Symptom**: Documentation claims X but code does Y (e.g., "Mojo First" but 0 .mojo files)
**Do**:

1. Fix documentation immediately (low risk)
2. Commit fix in audit PR
3. Note in audit report

### Issue: Discovered Pre-Existing Test Failures

**Symptom**: Running full test suite reveals failures unrelated to current work
**Do**:

1. Create separate branch to fix test failures
2. File issue tracking the failures
3. Fix tests in isolated PR
4. Note in audit report that tests were pre-existing failures

## Success Metrics

Audit is successful if:

- ✅ Every module has rating and GO/NO-GO status
- ✅ All P0 issues have GitHub issues filed
- ✅ Known-issue comments added to problem areas
- ✅ Comprehensive audit report created
- ✅ Clear prioritized roadmap for improvements
- ✅ Team understands technical debt and trade-offs

## Post-Audit Actions

1. **Immediate** (during audit session):
   - Fix documentation inaccuracies
   - Add known-issue comments
   - Create all GitHub issues
   - Generate audit report

2. **Before Release** (P0 items):
   - Fix blocking issues
   - Verify fixes don't break tests
   - Update audit report with resolution status

3. **After Release** (P1/P2 items):
   - Prioritize in backlog
   - Assign to sprints
   - Track progress
   - Update audit ratings quarterly

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't** rate based on "feel" - use objective metrics
❌ **Don't** try to fix everything during audit - document and track
❌ **Don't** skip baseline statistics phase
❌ **Don't** file issues without proposed solutions
❌ **Don't** give every module 7/10 - differentiate clearly
❌ **Don't** audit without creating tracking issues
❌ **Don't** ignore test failures found during audit
