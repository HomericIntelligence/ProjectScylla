  "outcome": "Successfully improved paper quality: fixed all errors (spelling, grammar), removed 47+ contractions, marked 24 colloquial segments, validated data accuracy, extracted archives, updated script paths",

    "Always verify quantitative claims by recomputing from source data",

    "Trusting analysis plan without verification - caused false positive on judge stats",
