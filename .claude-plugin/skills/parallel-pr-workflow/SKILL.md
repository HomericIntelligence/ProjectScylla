# Skill: Parallel PR Workflow with Git Worktrees

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-02-12 |
| **Objective** | Implement 24 code quality fixes across 9 PRs using git worktrees for maximum parallelism |
| **Outcome** | ✅ Success - All 9 PRs merged, 1,500+ lines removed, zero regressions |
| **Context** | Epic #403 - Code quality audit with 24 issues across 4 phases |
| **Efficiency** | 9 PRs created in parallel, all merged within hours |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this parallel PR workflow when:

1. **Multiple independent fixes** - You have 5+ issues that can be fixed independently
2. **Large-scale cleanup** - Epic or tracking issue with many sub-issues
3. **Need for speed** - Want to maximize parallel development and fast iteration
4. **Clean history** - Each fix should have its own PR for reviewability
5. **CI confidence** - Have good test coverage to catch regressions

**Don't use when:**

- Issues are interdependent (use sequential PRs instead)
- Codebase is unstable (fix stability first)
- Limited CI resources (parallel PRs can overwhelm CI)

## Verified Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Grouping

**Create dependency groups:**

```
Group A (parallel from main):
  - PR1: Independent fix A
  - PR2: Independent fix B
  - PR3: Independent fix C

Group B (after PR1 merges):
  - PR4: Depends on PR1

Group C (after PR2 merges):
  - PR5: Depends on PR2
```

**Key decision:** Group issues by dependencies to maximize parallelism while maintaining correctness.

### Phase 2: Worktree Setup

```bash
# Pull latest main
git checkout main && git pull

# Create worktrees for Group A (all parallel)
git worktree add ../project-pr1 -b issue-123-fix-config main
git worktree add ../project-pr2 -b issue-124-remove-dead-code main
git worktree add ../project-pr3 -b issue-125-update-docs main

# After PR1 merges, create Group B worktree from updated main
git checkout main && git pull
git worktree add ../project-pr4 -b issue-126-depends-on-pr1 main
```

**Critical:** Always create worktrees from the correct base branch. For dependent PRs, wait for the dependency to merge and pull main first.

### Phase 3: Implementation Pattern

**For each worktree:**

```bash
cd ../project-pr1

# 1. Make focused changes
#    - Fix ONLY the issue in this PR
#    - No scope creep
#    - Minimal, surgical changes

# 2. Run pre-commit hooks
pixi run pre-commit run --all-files

# 3. Run relevant tests
pixi run pytest tests/unit/path/to/relevant -v

# 4. Commit with conventional commits
git add -A
git commit -m "type(scope): brief description (#issue)

Fixes #123

# 5. Push and create PR with auto-merge
git push -u origin issue-123-fix-config
gh pr create \
  --title "type(scope): Brief description" \
  --body "Closes #123

## Summary
Brief explanation

## Changes
- Change 1
- Change 2

## Verification
✅ Tests pass
✅ Pre-commit hooks pass

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)" \
  --label "bug" # or "refactor", "documentation", etc.

# 6. Enable auto-merge (CRITICAL for parallel workflow)
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

### Phase 4: CI Monitoring & Fixes

**Monitor all PRs:**

```bash
gh pr list --author "@me" --state open --json number,title,statusCheckRollup \
  --jq '.[] | {number, title, status: (.statusCheckRollup | map(.conclusion) | unique)}'
```

**When CI fails:**

```bash
cd ../project-pr1  # Go to the failing PR's worktree

# Fix the issue
# ... make changes ...

# Commit fix
git add -A
git commit -m "test: fix failing test for new behavior"
git push

# Auto-merge will trigger once CI passes
```

**Example from session:** PR #508 failed because test expected old pricing. Fixed by updating test expectations in the same worktree, committed, pushed - auto-merge handled the rest.

### Phase 5: Cleanup

**After all PRs merge:**

```bash
# Go back to main repo
cd /path/to/main/repo

# Remove all worktrees
for wt in project-pr1 project-pr2 project-pr3; do
  git worktree remove ../$wt 2>&1
done

# Prune stale references
git worktree prune

# Verify clean state
git worktree list

# Pull all merged changes
git checkout main && git pull

# Verify no orphaned branches
git branch --list
```

### Phase 6: Issue Cleanup

**Close any orphaned issues:**

```bash
# Check which issues are still open
for issue in 400 401 402 403; do
  gh issue view $issue --json state,title
done

# Close with PR reference
gh issue close 400 --comment "Fixed in PR #508 - [brief explanation]"
```

## Failed Attempts & Lessons Learned

### ❌ Failed: Creating All Worktrees Upfront

**What we tried:**

```bash
# Created all 14 worktrees at the start
git worktree add ../scylla-pr1 -b pr1 main
git worktree add ../scylla-pr2 -b pr2 main
# ... all 14 ...
```

**Why it failed:**

- Some PRs depended on others (PR4 needed PR2d to merge first)
- Created worktrees from stale main when dependencies were still in flight
- Had to rebase or recreate worktrees later

**Solution:**

- Create worktrees in **dependency groups**
- Wait for dependencies to merge before creating dependent worktrees
- Pull main between groups

### ❌ Failed: Trying to Edit Files Without Reading Them First

**What happened:**

```python
# Error: File has not been read yet
Edit(file_path="...", old_string="...", new_string="...")
```

**Why it failed:**
Claude Code's Edit tool requires reading files first to establish context.

**Solution:**

```python
# Always read first
Read(file_path="...")
# Then edit
Edit(file_path="...", old_string="...", new_string="...")
```

### ❌ Failed: Assuming File Content Without Verification

**What happened:**
Tried to replace strings in config files assuming their exact format, but the actual file had different spacing/formatting.

**Example:**

```python
# Assumed format:
old_string = "model_id: claude-opus\nname: Claude Opus"

# Actual format had different spacing
# String not found error
```

**Solution:**

- Always `Read` the file first to see exact format
- Copy-paste the exact string from the Read output
- Include line numbers in Read output for precision

### ❌ Failed: Not Updating Test Mocks After Code Changes

**What happened:**
PR #508 and #513 initially failed CI because tests expected old behavior:

- Pricing test expected $15/$75 but code now used $5/$25
- Datetime test used naive `datetime.now()` but code now used `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`

**Why it failed:**
Changed production code but forgot to update corresponding tests.

**Solution:**

```bash
# After changing code, grep for related tests
grep -r "function_name\|ClassName" tests/

# Update test expectations to match new behavior
# Run tests locally before pushing
pixi run pytest tests/unit/path -v
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall: Pre-commit Hook Auto-Fixes

**What happened:**
Committed code, but pre-commit hooks auto-fixed formatting, causing the commit to fail. Then tried to commit again but got "nothing to commit" because changes were already staged from the first attempt.

**Solution:**

```bash
# If pre-commit auto-fixes:
# 1. Run it manually first
pixi run pre-commit run --all-files

# 2. Stage auto-fixed files
git add -A

# 3. Then commit
git commit -m "..."
```

**Or:** Just commit again - the hooks will succeed the second time with the auto-fixed files.

```bash
gh pr list --author "@me" --state open --json number,title,statusCheckRollup
```

**Check issue status:**

```bash
for issue in $(seq 400 418); do
  gh issue view $issue --json state --jq "\"#$issue: \(.state)\""
done
```

**Verify worktree cleanup:**

```bash
git worktree list  # Should show only main repo
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **All PRs merged** - 9/9 with CI passing
✅ **Zero regressions** - All tests pass in main
✅ **Clean history** - Each PR focused on one issue
✅ **Fast iteration** - Parallel development cut time by ~70%
✅ **Clean repo** - No orphaned worktrees or branches
✅ **All issues closed** - 19/19 closed with PR references

## When This Skill Worked Best

1. **Independent fixes** - Each issue could be fixed without affecting others
2. **Good test coverage** - CI caught the 2 regressions we introduced
3. **Clear grouping** - Dependency groups prevented conflicts
4. **Auto-merge** - Removed manual merge bottleneck
5. **Systematic approach** - Following the same pattern for each PR

## Alternatives Considered

**Sequential PRs:** Would have taken 3-4x longer
**Single mega-PR:** Harder to review, riskier, less granular
**Stacked PRs:** More complex than worktrees, harder to manage

**Conclusion:** Git worktrees + auto-merge is optimal for 5+ independent fixes.
