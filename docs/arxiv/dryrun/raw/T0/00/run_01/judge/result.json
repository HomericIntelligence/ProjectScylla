  "passed": true,
  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements: file exists, outputs exactly 'Hello, World!', and exits with code 0. The implementation is appropriately simple (single line of code), follows Python best practices, and demonstrates excellent engineering judgment for a trivial task. Minor note: .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories exist but these are environmental artifacts from the build pipeline, not agent-created files."
