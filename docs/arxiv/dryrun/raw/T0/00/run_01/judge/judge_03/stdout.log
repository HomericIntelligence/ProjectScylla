Perfect. Now I'll conduct the evaluation based on the rubric and evidence.

## Step 1: Parse Rubric
- **Functional** (weight 0.35): 4 items (F1-F4), binary checklist
  - F1: File exists (1.0 pt)
  - F2: Output contains "Hello, World!" (1.0 pt)
  - F3: Exit code 0 (1.0 pt)
  - F4: Output EXACTLY "Hello, World!" with no extras (0.5 pt)

- **Code Quality** (weight 0.20): 4 items (Q1-Q4), binary checklist
  - Q1: Valid Python syntax (1.0 pt)
  - Q2: Idiomatic Python, not overly complex (1.0 pt)
  - Q3: No unused imports/variables (1.0 pt)
  - Q4: PEP8 formatting via ruff (1.0 pt) - NA condition: ruff not available

- **Proportionality** (weight 0.15): 4 items (P1-P4), binary checklist
  - P1: ≤3 files created (1.0 pt)
  - P2: ≤3 lines of code in hello.py (1.0 pt)
  - P3: No unnecessary test files (1.0 pt) - NA condition: tests not required
  - P4: No build artifacts (__pycache__, *.pyc) (0.5 pt)

- **Build Pipeline** (weight 0.10): 4 items (B1-B4), binary checklist
  - B1: Python syntax check passes (1.0 pt)
  - B2: Python format check (ruff) (1.0 pt) - NA condition: ruff not available
  - B3: Tests pass (1.0 pt) - NA condition: tests not required
  - B4: Pre-commit hooks pass (1.0 pt) - NA condition: .pre-commit-config.yaml missing

- **Overall Quality** (weight 0.20): 1 item (OQ1), subjective
  - OQ1: Overall engineering judgment (2.0 pts)

## Step 2: Examine Workspace
- File `hello.py` exists at `/home/mvillmow/fullruns/test001-dryrun/2026-01-20T06-13-07-test-001/T0/00/run_01/workspace/hello.py`
- Content: Single line `print("Hello, World!")` with trailing newline
- Total files created: 1 (just hello.py)
- No build artifacts visible

## Step 3: Evaluate Each Item

### Functional Category

**F1**: File hello.py exists in workspace root
- Evidence: File exists at specified absolute path
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**F2**: Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'
- Evidence: Pipeline results show "Output: Hello, World!" and exit code 0
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**F3**: Script exits with code 0 (successful execution)
- Evidence: Pipeline shows "Exit code: 0"
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**F4**: Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output
- Evidence: Pipeline output shows exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra text
- Score: 0.5/0.5 ✓

Functional Category: 3.5/3.5

### Code Quality Category

**Q1**: Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)
- Evidence: Pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**Q2**: Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)
- Evidence: Single line `print("Hello, World!")` is the most idiomatic Python for this task
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**Q3**: No unused imports or variables
- Evidence: No imports or variable definitions in the code
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**Q4**: Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)
- Evidence: Pipeline shows "All checks passed!" for format check section
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

Code Quality Category: 4.0/4.0

### Proportionality Category

**P1**: Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)
- Evidence: Only hello.py created
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**P2**: Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3
- Evidence: hello.py contains 1 line of code
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**P3**: No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task
- Evidence: Task did not require tests, no test files created
- NA Condition Met: Task explicitly stated no tests required
- Score: N/A

**P4**: No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)
- Evidence: Workspace state shows only hello.py, no __pycache__ or .pyc files mentioned
- Score: 0.5/0.5 ✓

Proportionality Category: 2.5/2.5 (excluding P3 as N/A)

### Build Pipeline Category

**B1**: Python build/syntax check passes without errors
- Evidence: Pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**B2**: Python format check passes (if ruff available)
- Evidence: Pipeline shows format check passed ("All checks passed!")
- Score: 1.0/1.0 ✓

**B3**: Tests pass (if task requires tests)
- NA Condition Met: Task does not require tests
- Score: N/A

**B4**: Pre-commit hooks pass
- Evidence: Pipeline shows "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file" - no pre-commit configuration exists
- NA Condition Met: Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Score: N/A

Build Pipeline Category: 2.0/2.0 (excluding B3, B4 as N/A)

### Overall Quality Category

**OQ1**: Overall engineering judgment - Is the solution appropriately scoped for a Hello World task?
- Evidence:
  - Solution is perfectly simple: one line of code
  - Idiomatic and clear: uses built-in print() function directly
  - No over-engineering: no unnecessary abstractions, no excessive structure
  - Maintainability: trivial for a trivial task
  - A senior engineer would immediately approve this
  - Code quality scores are perfect: syntax valid, idiomatic, no unused elements, formatting clean
- Score: 2.0/2.0 ✓

Overall Quality Category: 2.0/2.0

## Step 4: Calculate Scores

**Functional**: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0
**Code Quality**: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0
**Proportionality**: 2.5/2.5 = 1.0
**Build Pipeline**: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0
**Overall Quality**: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0

**Weights**:
- Functional: 0.35
- Code Quality: 0.20
- Proportionality: 0.15
- Build Pipeline: 0.10
- Overall Quality: 0.20

**Final Score**: (1.0 × 0.35) + (1.0 × 0.20) + (1.0 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.10) + (1.0 × 0.20) = 1.0

## Step 5: Determine Grade
- Final Score: 1.0
- Pass Threshold: 0.60
- Grade: **S** (score of 1.0 = Amazing, exceeds requirements)

## Step 6: Consistency Check
- All items evaluated consistently as binary checklist items
- N/A decisions are justified by explicit na_conditions in rubric
- All scores are perfect (1.0) because:
  - File exists and executes correctly with exact output
  - Code is idiomatic and simple as required
  - No unnecessary complexity or files created
  - All quality checks pass
