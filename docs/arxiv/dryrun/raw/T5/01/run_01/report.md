### Individual Judges

#### Judge 1: claude-opus-4-5-20251101

| Score | 0.950 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that produces the exact expected output with exit code 0. The implementation is appropriately simple (single line of code) and follows Python best practices. Minor deduction for .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories remaining in workspace, though these are generated by the build pipeline rather than the agent directly.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 1.000 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | S |

**Reasoning:** The agent delivered a textbook-perfect Hello World implementation: a single print statement with no over-engineering, all functional requirements met, and all quality checks passed. The solution demonstrates appropriate scoping and professional simplicity, exactly what a senior engineer would approve for this trivial task.

#### Judge 3: claude-haiku-4-5

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 1.000 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | S |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully completed the task with perfect execution across all criteria. The solution is maximally simple and idiomatic, with clean code that passes all checks (syntax, format, execution). All functional requirements met: file created, exact output produced, exit code 0, and no unnecessary artifacts or files.
