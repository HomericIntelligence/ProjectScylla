Now let me evaluate according to the rubric. I'll assess each criterion systematically.

## Evaluation Analysis

Let me work through the rubric items:

### Functional Category (weight: 0.35)

**F1: File hello.py exists in workspace root**
- Evidence: File exists at `/home/mvillmow/fullruns/test001-dryrun/2026-01-20T06-13-07-test-001/T5/01/run_01/workspace/hello.py`
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**F2: Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Exit code: 0" and "Output: Hello, World!"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**F3: Script exits with code 0 (successful execution)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline output shows "Exit code: 0"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**F4: Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows output is exactly "Hello, World!\n" (single line with standard newline, which is standard for print()). The file content is `print("Hello, World!")` which produces exactly this output.
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 0.5/0.5

**Functional Category Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0**

### Code Quality Category (weight: 0.20)

**Q1: Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Q2: Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)**
- Evidence: File content is `print("Hello, World!")` - this is the simplest, most idiomatic way to solve this problem
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Q3: No unused imports or variables**
- Evidence: File has no imports and no variables
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Q4: Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python Format Check (PASSED)" with "All checks passed!"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Code Quality Category Score: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0**

### Proportionality Category (weight: 0.15)

**P1: Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)**
- Evidence: Workspace files excluding git/cache: `hello.py`, `README`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`. Files created by agent: only `hello.py`. Pre-existing workspace files: README, CLAUDE.md, .claude/settings.json
- The agent created 1 file (hello.py)
- Status: ✓ PASS (1 file ≤ 3)
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**P2: Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3**
- Evidence: File has 2 lines total (line 1: `print("Hello, World!")`, line 2: empty line/EOF)
- Status: ✓ PASS (2 lines ≤ 3)
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**P3: No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task**
- Evidence: Workspace contains no test files (pytest collected 0 items). The `.pytest_cache` is a build artifact, not a test file.
- na_condition: "Task explicitly required tests" - NOT applicable here
- Status: ✓ PASS (no test files created)
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**P4: No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)**
- Evidence: According to workspace filtering rules, we should ignore directories starting with periods and underscores. The workspace contains `.pytest_cache` and `.ruff_cache` which are cache/build artifacts that should be ignored per the evaluation rules.
- The agent did not create or leave __pycache__ or .pyc files in the main directory
- Status: ✓ PASS (build artifacts are ignored per evaluation rules)
- Points: 0.5/0.5

**Proportionality Category Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0**

### Build Pipeline Category (weight: 0.10)

**B1: Python build/syntax check passes without errors**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**B2: Python format check passes (if ruff available)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python Format Check (PASSED)" with "All checks passed!"
- na_condition: "ruff not available in workspace" - NOT applicable (ruff IS available)
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**B3: Tests pass (if task requires tests)**
- Evidence: Task does not require tests. Build pipeline shows "no tests ran in 0.01s"
- na_condition: "Task does not require tests" - APPLICABLE
- Status: N/A
- Points: N/A

**B4: Pre-commit hooks pass**
- Evidence: Pre-commit output shows "An error has occurred: InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file"
- na_condition: "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml" - APPLICABLE (no pre-commit config exists)
- Status: N/A
- Points: N/A

**Build Pipeline Category Score (excluding N/A items): 2.0/2.0 = 1.0**

### Overall Quality Category (weight: 0.20)

**OQ1: Overall engineering judgment - appropriately scoped for Hello World task?**
- Positive indicators:
  - Solution is maximally simple (1 line of actual code)
  - No over-engineering whatsoever
  - Perfect adherence to requirements
  - Idiomatic Python
  - Clear and immediate purpose
  - Would absolutely pass senior engineer review for a trivial task

- No issues identified
- Status: Excellent work appropriate for the task
- Points: 2.0/2.0

**Overall Quality Category Score: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0**

## Final Score Calculation

Categories:
1. Functional: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0 (weight: 0.35)
2. Code Quality: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0 (weight: 0.20)
3. Proportionality: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0 (weight: 0.15)
4. Build Pipeline: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0 (weight: 0.10, with B3 and B4 marked N/A)
5. Overall Quality: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0 (weight: 0.20)

Weighted Score:
- (1.0 × 0.35) + (1.0 × 0.20) + (1.0 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.10) + (1.0 × 0.20)
- = 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.20
- = 1.0

Grade: **S** (Score = 1.0, which meets the S grade threshold of 1.00)
