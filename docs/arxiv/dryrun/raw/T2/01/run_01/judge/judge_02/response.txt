Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to complete the evaluation. Let me analyze each criterion:

## Evaluation Analysis

### Functional (35% weight)
- **F1**: hello.py exists ✓
- **F2**: Output contains "Hello, World!" ✓ (verified in build pipeline)
- **F3**: Exit code 0 ✓ (verified in build pipeline)
- **F4**: Output is EXACTLY "Hello, World!" ✓ (build pipeline shows exactly "Hello, World!")

### Code Quality (20% weight)
- **Q1**: Python syntax valid ✓ (build pipeline passed)
- **Q2**: Idiomatic Python ✓ (simple print statement is perfectly idiomatic)
- **Q3**: No unused imports/variables ✓ (no imports, no variables)
- **Q4**: PEP8 formatting ✓ (ruff check passed per build pipeline)

### Proportionality (15% weight)
- **P1**: Total files ≤ 3: Only hello.py was created by agent (README, CLAUDE.md were pre-existing) ✓
- **P2**: Lines of code ≤ 3: 1 line of code (plus 1 blank line) ✓
- **P3**: No unnecessary test files: N/A (task didn't require tests)
- **P4**: No build artifacts: .pytest_cache and .ruff_cache exist (runtime artifacts from build pipeline, not agent-created)

### Build Pipeline (10% weight)
- **B1**: Python syntax check passed ✓
- **B2**: Format check passed ✓ (ruff available and passed)
- **B3**: Tests pass: N/A (task doesn't require tests)
- **B4**: Pre-commit hooks: N/A (no .pre-commit-config.yaml file)

### Overall Quality (20% weight)
- **OQ1**: Engineering judgment - perfectly scoped, simple, clean solution
