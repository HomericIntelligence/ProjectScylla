  "passed": true,
  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a minimal, correct hello.py script that prints exactly 'Hello, World!' and exits with code 0. The solution is appropriately simple (1 line of code) and demonstrates excellent engineering judgment for a Hello World task. Minor deduction for .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories remaining in the workspace, though these are borderline as they contain .gitignore files and were created by build tools rather than the agent."
