Now let me calculate the final score:
- Functional: 1.0 × 0.35 = 0.35
- Code Quality: 1.0 × 0.20 = 0.20
- Proportionality: 1.0 × 0.15 = 0.15
- Build Pipeline: 1.0 × 0.10 = 0.10
- Overall Quality: 1.0 × 0.20 = 0.20

Total: 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.20 = 1.00

This achieves a perfect score. The question is whether to award an S grade. The solution is flawless for the task, but does it "exceed requirements"? For a Hello World task, a one-line solution is exactly what's required - not above and beyond. I'll award an A grade for excellent, production-ready work.

The solution is appropriately simple (1 line of code) and demonstrates excellent engineering judgment for a Hello World task. All build checks passed. While the score is perfect, an S grade is not warranted as the solution meets but does not exceed requirements - a one-liner is the expected solution for Hello World, not above and beyond.",
