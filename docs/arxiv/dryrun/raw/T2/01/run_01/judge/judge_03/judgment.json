  "reasoning": "The agent delivered a perfect solution that exemplifies excellent engineering judgment. The hello.py script is minimal, clear, and accomplishes the task with zero over-engineering. All functional requirements are met (file exists, correct output, exit code 0, exact output format), code quality is pristine (valid syntax, idiomatic Python, no unused imports, PEP8 compliant), proportionality is excellent (1 line of code, minimal files, no unnecessary artifacts), and the build pipeline passes all applicable checks. The solution demonstrates wisdom in recognizing that a hello world task requires only a hello world solution.",
