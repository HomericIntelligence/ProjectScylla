#### Judge 1: claude-opus-4-5-20251101

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 0.960 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully created a simple, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements. The script prints exactly 'Hello, World!' and exits with code 0. The implementation is appropriately minimal (3 lines) with no over-engineering. Minor deduction for .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache remaining in workspace, though these are build pipeline artifacts rather than agent-created files.

| Score | 1.000 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | S |

**Reasoning:** The agent delivered a perfect Hello World implementation. The solution is appropriately minimal (4 lines with shebang, idiomatic Python using a simple print statement), meets all functional requirements exactly, passes all build/format checks, and demonstrates excellent engineering judgment by not over-engineering a trivial task. The inclusion of a proper shebang line shows attention to best practices without adding unnecessary complexity.
