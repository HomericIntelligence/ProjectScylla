I have all the information needed to evaluate. Let me analyze:

1. **hello.py exists** - confirmed with 3 lines of code (shebang, blank, print statement)
2. **Script execution** - Exit code 0, output "Hello, World!"
3. **Code quality** - Valid Python, idiomatic, no unused imports/variables
4. **Format check** - ruff passed
5. **Files created** - Only hello.py was created by agent (the README, CLAUDE.md, .claude/ are pre-existing infrastructure; .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache are runtime artifacts from the build pipeline)
