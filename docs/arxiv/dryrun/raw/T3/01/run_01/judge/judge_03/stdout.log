Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to evaluate the agent's work. Let me conduct a thorough evaluation against the rubric.

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Parse Rubric
The rubric has 5 categories with the following structure:
- **Functional (35%)**: F1-F4 (3.5 points total)
- **Code Quality (20%)**: Q1-Q4 (4.0 points total, Q4 may be N/A)
- **Proportionality (15%)**: P1-P4 (3.5 points total, P3 may be N/A)
- **Build Pipeline (10%)**: B1-B4 (4.0 points total, some may be N/A)
- **Overall Quality (20%)**: OQ1 (2.0 points subjective)

### Step 2: Examine Workspace
Files found (after excluding .git, .pytest_cache, .ruff_cache, .claude per rules):
- `hello.py` - The main deliverable
- `README` - Additional file
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Item

**FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY (35% weight)**

**F1: File hello.py exists in workspace root**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: `hello.py` exists at `/home/mvillmow/fullruns/test001-dryrun/2026-01-20T06-13-07-test-001/T3/01/run_01/workspace/hello.py`
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**F2: Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Exit code: 0" and "Output: Hello, World!"
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**F3: Script exits with code 0**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline explicitly shows "Exit code: 0"
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**F4: Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline output shows exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra text
- Achieved: 0.5/0.5

Functional Category Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0

**CODE QUALITY CATEGORY (20% weight)**

**Q1: Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**Q2: Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: The code is extremely simple and idiomatic. Single line: `print("Hello, World!")` - this is the most idiomatic way to print to stdout in Python.
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**Q3: No unused imports or variables**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: File contains only a shebang line and a single print statement. No imports or variables. `hello.py` line count shows 4 lines (including shebang and blank line), no unused code.
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**Q4: Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" for Python Format Check
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0
- NA Condition Check: Ruff IS available (as evidenced by the format check passing)

Code Quality Category Score: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0

**PROPORTIONALITY CATEGORY (15% weight)**

**P1: Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Files in root workspace (excluding environmental artifacts): `hello.py`, `README`, `CLAUDE.md`. That's 3 files, which meets the ≤3 requirement.
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**P2: Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: The file `hello.py` contains:
  - Line 1: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - Line 2: (blank)
  - Line 3: `print("Hello, World!")`
  - Line 4: (blank line at end)

  The actual lines of code (excluding shebang) = 1 line of actual code. Even counting the shebang, it's 2 lines, well under ≤3.
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**P3: No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- NA Condition: "Task explicitly required tests" - The task does NOT explicitly require tests. No test files were created.
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**P4: No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)**
- Status: ✓ PASS (with caveat)
- Evidence: The Glob search did not find any `__pycache__` or `.pyc` files in the source directory. The `.pytest_cache` and `.ruff_cache` directories are environmental artifacts that are properly ignored/excluded per workspace inspection rules.
- Achieved: 0.5/0.5

Proportionality Category Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0

**BUILD PIPELINE CATEGORY (10% weight)**

**B1: Python build/syntax check passes without errors**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0

**B2: Python format check passes (if ruff available)**
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" for Python Format Check. Ruff IS available.
- Achieved: 1.0/1.0
- NA Condition: "ruff not available in workspace" - Ruff IS available, so this is not N/A

**B3: Tests pass (if task requires tests)**
- Status: N/A
- Evidence: Task description does not explicitly require tests. Build pipeline shows "no tests ran". The na_condition states "Task does not require tests" which applies here.
- Achieved: N/A

**B4: Pre-commit hooks pass**
- Status: N/A
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows an error: "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file". The na_condition states "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml" which is true.
- Achieved: N/A

Build Pipeline Category Score: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0 (excluding N/A items)

**OVERALL QUALITY CATEGORY (20% weight, subjective)**

**OQ1: Overall engineering judgment - Is the solution appropriately scoped for a Hello World task?**

The solution demonstrates excellent engineering judgment for this task:

**Positive Indicators:**
1. Exceptional simplicity: The code is minimalist and does exactly what's asked, no more, no less (+0.5)
2. Professional presentation: Includes proper shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) showing awareness of executable script conventions (+0.3)
3. Perfect adherence to requirements: Meets all specified criteria exactly - correct filename, correct output, correct exit code, created using relative paths (+0.4)
4. Code quality: Idiomatic Python, passes all checks, follows PEP8 (+0.3)
5. Clean workspace: No unnecessary files, test files, or build artifacts. Proportionality is excellent (+0.2)

**Potential Deductions:**
- None identifiable. The solution is not over-engineered, is appropriately scoped, and a senior engineer would immediately approve this PR for a hello world task.

Net Assessment: 1.9/2.0 (deduct 0.1 only if being extremely critical about absolute perfection, but in this context, the solution is exemplary)

Overall Quality Category Score: 1.9/2.0 = 0.95

### Step 4: Calculate Scores

| Category | Achieved | Max | Score | Weight |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|--------|
| Functional | 3.5 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 0.35 |
| Code Quality | 4.0 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 0.20 |
| Proportionality | 3.5 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 0.15 |
| Build Pipeline | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 0.10 |
| Overall Quality | 1.9 | 2.0 | 0.95 | 0.20 |

**Final Score**: (1.0 × 0.35) + (1.0 × 0.20) + (1.0 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.10) + (0.95 × 0.20) = 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.19 = 0.99

### Step 5: Determine Outcome
- Final Score: 0.99
- Pass Threshold: 0.60
- **PASSED**: Yes
- Grade: **A** (0.80 or higher)

Actually, the score is 0.99, which qualifies for consideration of **S grade** (1.00). However, S grade requires the score to be exactly 1.0 and requires specific instances of work exceeding requirements. While the solution is nearly perfect, the 0.1 deduction in the subjective category (which represents a minor acknowledgment that no solution is perfectly flawless in practice) prevents it from reaching exactly 1.0. Therefore, **A grade** is appropriate.

### Step 6: Consistency Check
- All binary items are scored consistently (either 0 or full points)
- N/A items properly applied
- Deductions are justified and proportional
- Similar issues would receive similar treatment

### Step 7: Synthesize Reasoning
The agent successfully created a perfect Hello World script that meets all technical requirements. The solution demonstrates excellent engineering judgment by being appropriately scoped, idiomatic, clean, and professional. All functional, code quality, and proportionality criteria are met perfectly, with no unnecessary artifacts or over-engineering.
