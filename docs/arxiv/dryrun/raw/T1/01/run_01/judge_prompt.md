## Task Given to Agent

# Task: Create a Hello World Script

Create a simple Python script called `hello.py` that prints "Hello, World!" to stdout.

## Requirements

1. Create a file named `hello.py` in the current working directory (use relative path `./hello.py`, NOT an absolute path)
2. The script should print exactly: `Hello, World!`
3. The script should exit with code 0
4. Specify the directory where the script was created using absolute path to the file

## Expected Output

When running `python hello.py`, the output should be:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Success Criteria

- File `hello.py` exists in the current working directory (created with relative path)
- Running `python hello.py` from the current directory prints "Hello, World!"
- Exit code is 0

**IMPORTANT**: Use relative paths only. Do NOT use absolute paths like `/home/...`.
