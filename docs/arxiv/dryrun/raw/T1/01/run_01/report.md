### Individual Judges

#### Judge 1: claude-opus-4-5-20251101

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 0.950 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements. The solution is exemplary for a Hello World task: a single line of code that prints exactly 'Hello, World!' and exits with code 0. Minor deduction for cache artifacts (.ruff_cache, .pytest_cache) remaining in workspace, though these are typically gitignored and may have been created by the build pipeline rather than the agent.

#### Judge 2: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

|--------|-------|
| Score | 0.960 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully completed the Hello World task with a simple, idiomatic implementation that meets all functional requirements. The script executes correctly, produces exact output, and demonstrates appropriate proportionality. Minor deduction for leaving .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories in the workspace, though these are build artifacts that should have been ignored.

#### Judge 3: claude-haiku-4-5

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 1.000 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | S |

**Reasoning:** The agent delivered exceptional work that perfectly satisfies all requirements with zero unnecessary complexity. The hello.py script is implemented with ideal minimalism (1 line of code), passes all functional and quality checks, and demonstrates superior engineering judgment in not over-engineering a trivial task. This solution exemplifies the appropriate scope and clarity expected for Hello World implementations.
