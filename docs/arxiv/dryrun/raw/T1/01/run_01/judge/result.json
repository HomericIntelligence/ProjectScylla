  "score": 0.9700000000000001,
  "passed": true,
  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements. The solution is exemplary for a Hello World task: a single line of code that prints exactly 'Hello, World!' and exits with code 0. Minor deduction for cache artifacts (.ruff_cache, .pytest_cache) remaining in workspace, though these are typically gitignored and may have been created by the build pipeline rather than the agent."
