Now I have all the information needed to evaluate the agent's work. Let me proceed with the systematic evaluation:

```json
{
  "score": 0.96,
  "passed": true,
  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the Hello World task with a simple, idiomatic implementation that meets all functional requirements. The script executes correctly, produces exact output, and demonstrates appropriate proportionality. Minor deduction for leaving .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories in the workspace, though these are build artifacts that should have been ignored.",
