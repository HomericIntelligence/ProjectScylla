Perfect. Now I have all the information needed to evaluate the task. Let me proceed with the systematic evaluation following the evaluation process.

## Step 1: Parse Rubric ✓

The rubric has 5 categories:
- **Functional** (weight: 0.35): 4 items, 3.5 max points
- **Code Quality** (weight: 0.20): 4 items, 4.0 max points (Q4 has na_condition)
- **Proportionality** (weight: 0.15): 4 items, 3.5 max points (P3 has na_condition)
- **Build Pipeline** (weight: 0.10): 4 items, 4.0 max points (B2, B3, B4 have na_conditions)
- **Overall Quality** (weight: 0.20): 1 subjective item, 2.0 max points

Pass threshold: 0.60

## Step 2: Examine Workspace ✓

Relevant files (excluding environmental artifacts per rules):
- `hello.py` - created, 1 line of code
- `README` - exists
- `CLAUDE.md` - exists

Excluded (per filtering rules):
- `.git/` - version control
- `.claude/` - configuration
- `.ruff_cache/` - build artifact
- `.pytest_cache/` - test artifact

## Step 3: Evaluate Items

### Functional Category (weight: 0.35)

**F1: File hello.py exists in workspace root**
- Evidence: File exists at `/home/mvillmow/fullruns/test001-dryrun/2026-01-20T06-13-07-test-001/T1/01/run_01/workspace/hello.py`
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**F2: Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'**
- Evidence: Build pipeline output shows: "Output: Hello, World!" with exit code 0
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**F3: Script exits with code 0 (successful execution)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline output shows "Exit code: 0"
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**F4: Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows exact output "Hello, World!" with no extra text
- Type: Binary
- Result: **0.5/0.5** ✓

**Functional Category Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0**

### Code Quality Category (weight: 0.20)

**Q1: Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**Q2: Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)**
- Evidence: File contains single `print()` statement, the most idiomatic way to solve this problem
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**Q3: No unused imports or variables**
- Evidence: Code has no imports or variables, just a single print statement
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**Q4: Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" under Python Format Check
- Type: Binary
- na_condition: "ruff not available in workspace" - DOES NOT APPLY (ruff is clearly available and passed)
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**Code Quality Category Score: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0**

### Proportionality Category (weight: 0.15)

**P1: Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)**
- Evidence: Workspace contains hello.py, README, CLAUDE.md, and configuration files. Counting new files agent created: only `hello.py` (README and CLAUDE.md were pre-existing)
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**P2: Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3**
- Evidence: hello.py has 1 line of code (the print statement) plus 1 blank line = 2 lines total
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**P3: No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task**
- Evidence: No test files exist in workspace
- Type: Binary
- na_condition: "Task explicitly required tests" - DOES NOT APPLY (task did not require tests)
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**P4: No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)**
- Evidence: Glob output shows .ruff_cache/ and .pytest_cache/ directories exist but are properly ignored (start with period). No __pycache__ or .pyc files visible at root level.
- Type: Binary (evaluating per workspace inspection rules - cache directories starting with period are environmental artifacts outside agent control)
- Result: **0.5/0.5** ✓

**Proportionality Category Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0**

### Build Pipeline Category (weight: 0.10)

**B1: Python build/syntax check passes without errors**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Type: Binary
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**B2: Python format check passes (if ruff available)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows format check "All checks passed!"
- Type: Binary
- na_condition: "ruff not available in workspace" - DOES NOT APPLY (ruff clearly passed checks)
- Result: **1.0/1.0** ✓

**B3: Tests pass (if task requires tests)**
- Evidence: Test section shows "no tests ran in 0.01s" which is correct since task did not require tests
- Type: Binary
- na_condition: "Task does not require tests" - APPLIES
- Result: **N/A**

**B4: Pre-commit hooks pass**
- Evidence: Pre-commit output shows "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file"
- Type: Binary
- na_condition: "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml" - APPLIES (no .pre-commit-config.yaml file in workspace)
- Result: **N/A**

**Build Pipeline Category Score: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0** (only B1 and B2 apply)

### Overall Quality Category (weight: 0.20)

**OQ1: Overall engineering judgment - appropriately scoped for Hello World task?**
- Type: Subjective (2.0 points max)
- Evidence Analysis:
  - **Positive Indicators:**
    - Extremely simple solution: single print statement (best possible for this task)
    - Perfect clarity: no ambiguity, easy to understand at a glance
    - Follows UNIX philosophy: does one thing well
    - No over-engineering: agent correctly resisted adding unnecessary complexity
    - Clean, maintainable code that sets good foundation patterns
    - Demonstrates good judgment in not adding tests, documentation, or configuration for trivial task

  - **Issues Identified:**
    - None significant - this is exemplary work for the scope

- Assessment: This is exactly how a senior engineer would implement a Hello World task. The simplicity is the strength. The agent showed good judgment in recognizing task triviality and not over-engineering. This deserves full credit.

**Result: 2.0/2.0** ✓

**Overall Quality Category Score: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0**

## Step 4: Calculate Scores

| Category | Achieved | Max | Score | Weight |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|--------|
| Functional | 3.5 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 0.35 |
| Code Quality | 4.0 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 0.20 |
| Proportionality | 3.5 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 0.15 |
| Build Pipeline | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 0.10 |
| Overall Quality | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 0.20 |

**Weighted Score:**
(1.0 × 0.35) + (1.0 × 0.20) + (1.0 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.10) + (1.0 × 0.20) = **1.0**

## Step 5: Determine Outcome

Score: **1.0**
Pass Threshold: **0.60**
**PASSED** ✓

Grade Scale mapping:
- 1.0 = S grade ✓

## Step 6: S Grade Verification

For S grade, must identify at least two instances of work exceeding requirements:

1. **Perfect proportionality**: Solution uses exactly 1 line of code (requirement was ≤3), demonstrating exceptional minimalism and understanding of task scope
2. **Exceptional judgment**: Agent correctly resisted over-engineering by not creating unnecessary tests, configuration files, or documentation for a trivial task
3. **Zero technical debt**: No unused imports, no unnecessary complexity, no potential future maintenance burdens

**S Grade Justified** ✓

## Step 7: Consistency Check ✓

- All binary items evaluated consistently
- No N/A decisions are contradictory
- Evidence supports all scores
- No clustering around round numbers (all items either 0 or 1 at max)
- Final score of 1.0 is appropriate for this exceptional execution
