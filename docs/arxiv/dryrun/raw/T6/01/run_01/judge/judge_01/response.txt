Now I have all the information needed to evaluate the agent's work. Let me analyze against each rubric criterion:

**Workspace Analysis:**
- `hello.py` exists (3 lines including shebang, blank line, and print statement)
- Files in workspace root: README, CLAUDE.md, hello.py (3 files, though README and CLAUDE.md appear to be pre-existing)
- Cache directories: .ruff_cache, .pytest_cache (these are runtime artifacts, should be ignored per evaluation rules)
- No __pycache__ directory visible

**Build Pipeline Results:**
- Python syntax check: PASSED
- Script execution: Exit code 0, Output: "Hello, World!"
- Python format check (ruff): PASSED
- Tests: No tests ran (0 collected) - PASSED
- Pre-commit: Error due to missing .pre-commit-config.yaml file (N/A condition met)
