Now I have the rubric, task description, agent's output, and workspace state. Let me evaluate the agent's work systematically.

## Evaluation

I'll examine each criterion in the rubric:

### Step 1: Parse Rubric
The rubric has 5 categories with clear binary and subjective items:
- **Functional** (0.35 weight): 4 binary items checking file existence, output content, exit code, and exact output
- **Code Quality** (0.20 weight): 4 items checking syntax, idioms, unused imports, and PEP8 compliance
- **Proportionality** (0.15 weight): 4 items checking file count, LOC, test files, and build artifacts
- **Build Pipeline** (0.10 weight): 4 items checking syntax, format, tests, and pre-commit hooks
- **Overall Quality** (0.20 weight): 1 subjective item worth 2.0 points

Pass threshold: 0.60 (B grade or higher)

### Step 2: Examine Workspace
From the provided evidence:
- File `hello.py` was created
- Pipeline results show: syntax check passed, script executed with exit code 0, format check passed, no tests ran (expected), pre-commit hooks failed (no config file)

### Step 3: Evaluate Items

**FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY:**

- **F1** (File hello.py exists): ✅ **PASS** - File was created and is listed in workspace state. Evidence: "Files modified/created by agent: `hello.py` (created)"

- **F2** (Output contains "Hello, World!"): ✅ **PASS** - Pipeline output shows "Hello, World!" printed. Evidence: "Output: Hello, World!"

- **F3** (Exit code 0): ✅ **PASS** - Pipeline output shows "Exit code: 0"

- **F4** (Output is EXACTLY "Hello, World!" with no extra text): ✅ **PASS** - Pipeline output shows exactly this with no extra text or trailing output beyond the output section.

**CODE QUALITY CATEGORY:**

- **Q1** (Python syntax valid): ✅ **PASS** - "Python syntax check passed"

- **Q2** (Code is idiomatic Python, not overly complex): ✅ **PASS** - The agent's code shown is `#!/usr/bin/env python3` followed by `print("Hello, World!")` which is idiomatic and simple.

- **Q3** (No unused imports or variables): ✅ **PASS** - The script contains no imports or variables, just a direct print statement.

- **Q4** (PEP8 formatting, ruff passes): ✅ **PASS** - Pipeline shows "Python Format Check (PASSED)" with "All checks passed!"

**PROPORTIONALITY CATEGORY:**

- **P1** (Total files created ≤ 3): ✅ **PASS** - Only `hello.py` was created, which is 1 file, well under the limit of 3.

- **P2** (Total LOC in hello.py ≤ 3): ✅ **PASS** - The script shown has 3 lines total (shebang + blank line + print statement), meeting the requirement exactly.

- **P3** (No unnecessary test files for trivial task): ✅ **PASS** - No test files were created. The task explicitly did not require tests. N/A condition applies, but the agent correctly didn't create test files.

- **P4** (Build artifacts cleaned up): ✅ **PASS** - No evidence of __pycache__ or .pyc files in the workspace state. The pipeline ran successfully without leaving artifacts visible.

**BUILD PIPELINE CATEGORY:**

- **B1** (Python build/syntax check passes): ✅ **PASS** - "Python syntax check passed"

- **B2** (Python format check passes): ✅ **PASS** - "All checks passed!" shown in format check section. Ruff is available (not N/A).

- **B3** (Tests pass if required): N/A - Task does not explicitly require tests. The N/A condition applies.

- **B4** (Pre-commit hooks pass): ❌ **FAIL** - "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file". The workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml. This triggers the N/A condition, so this item is N/A.

**OVERALL QUALITY (SUBJECTIVE):**

- **OQ1** (Overall engineering judgment): The solution is appropriately scoped for Hello World - it's minimal, clear, and idiomatic. The shebang line is a nice touch showing professionalism. There's no over-engineering, complexity is zero, and a senior engineer would approve this immediately. The agent provided clear verification and met all requirements. This deserves high marks.

Award: **1.95/2.0** (deduction of 0.05 for the pre-commit hook failure, though it's outside the agent's control - the workspace lacks the config file, so this is environmental)

Actually, reviewing more carefully: B4 is N/A because ".pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file" matches the condition "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml". The error itself is just evidence that the condition is met. The agent should not be penalized for this.

Award: **2.0/2.0** - The solution is perfect for the task scope. The agent executed cleanly, provided verification, met all requirements, and chose appropriate simplicity.

### Step 4: Calculate Scores

**Functional:** 4.0 / 4.5 = 0.889
- F1: 1.0/1.0
- F2: 1.0/1.0
- F3: 1.0/1.0
- F4: 1.0/0.5

Wait, let me recalculate. F4 is worth 0.5 points max, and it passes, so it's 0.5/0.5.

**Functional:** 3.5 / 3.5 = 1.0

**Code Quality:** 4.0 / 4.0 = 1.0
- Q1: 1.0/1.0
- Q2: 1.0/1.0
- Q3: 1.0/1.0
- Q4: 1.0/1.0

**Proportionality:** 3.0 / 3.5 = 0.857
- P1: 1.0/1.0
- P2: 1.0/1.0
- P3: N/A (condition applies: "Task explicitly required tests" - FALSE, so... wait)

Let me re-read P3: "No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task" with "na_condition: Task explicitly required tests"

The condition is "Task explicitly required tests". Looking at the task, it does NOT explicitly require tests. Therefore the N/A condition is FALSE, and P3 applies. The agent created no test files, so P3 passes: 1.0/1.0.

- P4: 0.5/0.5 (no build artifacts visible)

**Proportionality:** 3.5 / 3.5 = 1.0

**Build Pipeline:** 2.0 / 2.0 = 1.0
- B1: 1.0/1.0
- B2: 1.0/1.0
- B3: N/A (condition: "Task does not require tests" - TRUE)
- B4: N/A (condition: "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml" - TRUE)

**Build Pipeline:** 2.0 / 2.0 = 1.0

**Overall Quality:** 2.0 / 2.0 = 1.0
- OQ1: 2.0/2.0 (perfect execution for task scope)

### Step 5: Calculate Final Score

All items evaluated (no category entirely N/A):
- Functional: 1.0 × 0.35 = 0.35
- Code Quality: 1.0 × 0.20 = 0.20
- Proportionality: 1.0 × 0.15 = 0.15
- Build Pipeline: 1.0 × 0.10 = 0.10
- Overall Quality: 1.0 × 0.20 = 0.20

**Final Score:** 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.20 = **1.0**

### Step 6: Consistency Check
- All binary items that passed received full credit
- N/A items were correctly identified and excluded
- The subjective item was assessed fairly based on the actual quality
- No inconsistencies in similar items across categories

### Step 7: Determine Grade
Score: 1.0 → Exceeds 0.80 (A threshold) → Grade A or higher
Score: 1.0 exactly → Could qualify for S grade if exceptional

The solution demonstrates exceptional work:
1. **Perfectly scoped** - No over-engineering for a Hello World task
2. **Idiomatic Python** - Uses shebang for proper scripting
3. **All requirements met** - File exists, output exact, exit code 0
4. **Professional** - Clean code, proper shebang line
5. **Minimal but complete** - 3 lines of code, exactly as required

This warrants an **S grade** for exceeding expectations on a seemingly trivial task.
