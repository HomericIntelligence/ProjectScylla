| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements. The script prints exactly 'Hello, World!', exits with code 0, and uses clean Python syntax with only 3 lines. Minor deduction for the presence of .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories (runtime artifacts from verification), though these are inconsequential. The solution demonstrates appropriate engineering judgment - simple, maintainable, and exactly scoped for the task.

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully completed all functional requirements with a clean, minimal implementation. The hello.py script works correctly, exits with code 0, and produces exact output. Minor deduction for the .ruff_cache directory remaining in the workspace, though this is a tool artifact that could be gitignored.

**Reasoning:** The agent executed flawlessly, creating a perfectly scoped Hello World script that meets all requirements. The solution is idiomatic Python with appropriate shebang, zero over-engineering, and all verification steps passed. Perfect execution across all evaluation categories.
