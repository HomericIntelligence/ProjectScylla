Now I have all the information I need to conduct the evaluation. Let me systematically assess each rubric item.

## Evaluation Analysis

### Step 1: Parse Rubric
The rubric defines 5 categories with a total of 14 items (one with an N/A condition). The categories are:
- Functional (weight 0.35): 4 items, 3.5 points total
- Code Quality (weight 0.20): 4 items, 4.0 points total
- Proportionality (weight 0.15): 4 items, 3.5 points total
- Build Pipeline (weight 0.10): 4 items, 4.0 points total
- Overall Quality (weight 0.20): 1 subjective item, 2.0 points total

### Step 2: Examine Workspace
Relevant files in workspace (after filtering ignored directories like .git, .pytest_cache, .ruff_cache):
- `hello.py` (created - 1 line of code)
- `README` (pre-existing)
- `CLAUDE.md` (pre-existing)
- `.claude/settings.json` (pre-existing, configuration)

### Step 3: Evaluate Items

**FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY (0.35 weight)**

**F1**: "File hello.py exists in workspace root"
- Evidence: `hello.py` exists at `/home/mvillmow/fullruns/test001-dryrun/2026-01-20T06-13-07-test-001/T4/01/run_01/workspace/hello.py`
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**F2**: "Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'"
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Output: Hello, World!" with exit code 0
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**F3**: "Script exits with code 0"
- Evidence: Build pipeline explicitly shows "Exit code: 0"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**F4**: "Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output"
- Evidence: Build pipeline output shows exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra characters
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 0.5/0.5

Functional Category Total: 3.5/3.5

**CODE QUALITY CATEGORY (0.20 weight)**

**Q1**: "Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)"
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Q2**: "Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)"
- Evidence: `hello.py` contains a single print statement. This is maximally idiomatic for a Hello World program.
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Q3**: "No unused imports or variables"
- Evidence: The script contains only one line: `print("Hello, World!")`. No imports or variables defined.
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**Q4**: "Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)"
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" in the Python Format Check section. This indicates ruff passed.
- N/A Condition Check: "ruff not available in workspace" - ruff IS available and was successfully run
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

Code Quality Category Total: 4.0/4.0

**PROPORTIONALITY CATEGORY (0.15 weight)**

**P1**: "Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)"
- Evidence: Only `hello.py` was created by the agent. README and CLAUDE.md were pre-existing. No .gitignore was created.
- Count: 1 file created
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**P2**: "Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3"
- Evidence: hello.py contains exactly 1 line of actual code (line 1 has the print statement; line 2 is blank)
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**P3**: "No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task"
- Evidence: No test files were created by the agent. The test output shows "no tests ran".
- N/A Condition Check: "Task explicitly required tests" - Task description explicitly does NOT require tests; it's a simple Hello World script
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**P4**: "No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)"
- Evidence: Glob results show `.pytest_cache` and `.ruff_cache` directories exist. These are build/runtime artifacts that should have been cleaned up per the CLAUDE.md cleanup requirements ("Remove any temporary files created during task completion (build artifacts, cache files, etc.)").
- Status: ✗ FAIL - Build artifacts were not cleaned up
- Points: 0.0/0.5

Proportionality Category Total: 3.0/3.5

**BUILD PIPELINE CATEGORY (0.10 weight)**

**B1**: "Python build/syntax check passes without errors"
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**B2**: "Python format check passes (if ruff available)"
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" in Python Format Check section
- N/A Condition Check: "ruff not available in workspace" - ruff IS available (we can see successful execution)
- Status: ✓ PASS
- Points: 1.0/1.0

**B3**: "Tests pass (if task requires tests)"
- Evidence: Test output shows "no tests ran" which is appropriate
- N/A Condition Check: "Task does not require tests" - CLAUDE.md and task description do not require tests. This is a trivial task.
- Status: N/A
- Points: N/A

**B4**: "Pre-commit hooks pass"
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows error "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file"
- N/A Condition Check: "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml" - Confirmed, no .pre-commit-config.yaml file exists
- Status: N/A
- Points: N/A

Build Pipeline Category Total: 2.0/2.0 (excluding B3 and B4 which are N/A)

**OVERALL QUALITY CATEGORY (0.20 weight)**

**OQ1**: "Overall engineering judgment: Is the solution appropriately scoped for a Hello World task? Consider: simplicity vs over-engineering, maintainability, clarity, and whether a senior engineer would approve this PR."
- Evidence Analysis:
  - **Simplicity vs Over-engineering**: The solution is perfectly minimalist. A single print statement is the absolute minimum necessary. No over-engineering whatsoever. (+0.4)
  - **Maintainability**: A single-line script with no dependencies has zero maintenance burden. (+0.3)
  - **Clarity**: The code is crystal clear - anyone can understand what it does instantly. (+0.3)
  - **Senior Engineer Approval**: A senior engineer would approve this immediately as an exemplary Hello World implementation. However, the agent failed to clean up build artifacts (.pytest_cache, .ruff_cache) as explicitly required in CLAUDE.md cleanup requirements. (-0.3)
  - **Net Assessment**: The code itself is perfect (1.3/1.3 in positive indicators), but the failure to clean up artifacts (-0.3) represents incomplete task execution despite explicit cleanup requirements.

Overall Quality Category Score: 1.7/2.0

### Step 4: Calculate Category Scores

**Functional**: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0
**Code Quality**: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0
**Proportionality**: 3.0/3.5 = 0.857
**Build Pipeline**: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0 (after excluding N/A items)
**Overall Quality**: 1.7/2.0 = 0.85

### Step 5: Calculate Final Score

Weights:
- Functional: 0.35
- Code Quality: 0.20
- Proportionality: 0.15
- Build Pipeline: 0.10
- Overall Quality: 0.20
- Total: 1.0

Final Score = (1.0 × 0.35) + (1.0 × 0.20) + (0.857 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.10) + (0.85 × 0.20)
            = 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.1286 + 0.10 + 0.17
            = 0.9286

### Step 6: Determine Grade

Score: 0.9286
Pass Threshold: 0.60
Grade Scale: Score ≥ 0.80 → A grade

The score of 0.9286 exceeds 0.80, yielding an **A grade**.

### Step 7: Exceptional Work Check

For S grade (1.0), we need to identify work exceeding requirements. While the code itself is excellent, the failure to clean up artifacts prevents the S grade. The agent executed the core task perfectly but did not fully meet the cleanup requirement stated in CLAUDE.md.
