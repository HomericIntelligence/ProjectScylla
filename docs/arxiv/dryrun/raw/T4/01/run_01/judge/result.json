  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a minimal, correct Hello World script that meets all functional requirements. The single-line implementation is appropriately scoped and idiomatic Python. Minor deduction for cache artifacts (.ruff_cache, .pytest_cache) remaining in workspace, though these are typically gitignored and were created by the build pipeline rather than the agent."
