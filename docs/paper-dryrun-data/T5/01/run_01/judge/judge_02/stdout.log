Now I have all the information needed to evaluate this submission. Let me analyze each rubric item:

## Evaluation Analysis

### Functional Category (weight: 0.35)

**F1**: File hello.py exists in workspace root
- Evidence: hello.py exists at workspace root as confirmed by workspace state
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**F2**: Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Output: Hello, World!" with exit code 0
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**F3**: Script exits with code 0 (successful execution)
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Exit code: 0"
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**F4**: Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output
- Evidence: Build pipeline output shows exactly "Hello, World!" with nothing else
- Score: 0.5/0.5

### Code Quality Category (weight: 0.20)

**Q1**: Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**Q2**: Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)
- Evidence: The code is a single print statement - perfectly idiomatic for this task
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**Q3**: No unused imports or variables
- Evidence: The code has no imports and no variables, just a print statement
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**Q4**: Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" for format check, ruff is available
- Score: 1.0/1.0

### Proportionality Category (weight: 0.15)

**P1**: Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)
- Evidence: Only hello.py was created by the agent (README and CLAUDE.md preexist)
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**P2**: Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3
- Evidence: hello.py contains 1 line of code (line 1) plus 1 blank line (line 2) = 1 line of code
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**P3**: No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task
- Evidence: No test files were created by the agent. Pytest shows "collected 0 items"
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**P4**: No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)
- Evidence: .pytest_cache and .ruff_cache directories exist (generated by linter/test tools, not Python runtime). No __pycache__ directories found. These are tool cache directories.
- Deduction: These cache directories (.pytest_cache, .ruff_cache) are generated by the build pipeline tools, not by the agent. However, per the workspace inspection rules, directories starting with periods should be ignored as environmental artifacts. No deduction warranted.
- Score: 0.5/0.5

### Build Pipeline Category (weight: 0.10)

**B1**: Python build/syntax check passes without errors
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**B2**: Python format check passes (if ruff available)
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" for ruff format check
- Score: 1.0/1.0

**B3**: Tests pass (if task requires tests)
- Evidence: Task does not require tests. No test files exist.
- Score: N/A (na_condition met)

**B4**: Pre-commit hooks pass
- Evidence: Pre-commit output shows "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file"
- This indicates no .pre-commit-config.yaml exists in the workspace
- Score: N/A (na_condition met: "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml")

### Overall Quality Category (weight: 0.20)

**OQ1**: Overall engineering judgment (2.0 points)
- Positive indicators:
  - Solution is appropriately scoped - single line print statement is perfect for Hello World
  - No over-engineering whatsoever
  - Clean, readable, and maintainable
  - Follows Python best practices
  - No unnecessary files or complexity
- Issues: None identified
- This is a textbook perfect Hello World implementation
- Score: 2.0/2.0

## Final Calculation

**Functional**: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0 × 0.35 = 0.35
**Code Quality**: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0 × 0.20 = 0.20
**Proportionality**: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0 × 0.15 = 0.15
**Build Pipeline**: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0 × 0.10 = 0.10 (B3, B4 N/A)
**Overall Quality**: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0 × 0.20 = 0.20

**Total Score**: 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.20 = 1.00

This is a perfect score. The implementation is exactly what's needed for a Hello World task - nothing more, nothing less.
