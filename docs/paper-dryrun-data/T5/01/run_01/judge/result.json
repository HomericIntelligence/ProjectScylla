  "passed": true,
  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that produces the exact expected output with exit code 0. The implementation is appropriately simple (single line of code) and follows Python best practices. Minor deduction for .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories remaining in workspace, though these are generated by the build pipeline rather than the agent directly."
