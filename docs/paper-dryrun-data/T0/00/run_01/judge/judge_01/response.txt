Let me recalculate the final score properly with the correct weights and re-check P3:

- functional: weight 0.35, score 1.0
- code_quality: weight 0.20, score 1.0
- proportionality: weight 0.15, score 1.0 (need to verify P3)
- build_pipeline: weight 0.10, score 1.0
- overall_quality: weight 0.20, score 0.95

P3's na_condition is "Task explicitly required tests" - the task did NOT explicitly require tests, so this condition is NOT met. Therefore P3 should be evaluated. The agent did not create any test files, so P3 passes with full points.

Final score = 0.35(1.0) + 0.20(1.0) + 0.15(1.0) + 0.10(1.0) + 0.20(0.95) = 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.19 = 0.99
