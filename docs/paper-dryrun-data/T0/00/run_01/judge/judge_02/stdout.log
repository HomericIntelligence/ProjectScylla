Now I have all the information needed to evaluate the agent's work. Let me analyze each rubric item:

**Workspace Analysis:**
- Files created: `hello.py`, `README` (2 files)
- Directories: `.claude`, `.git`, `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache` (runtime artifacts, should be ignored per evaluation rules)
- `hello.py` contains: `print("Hello, World!")` followed by a newline (1 line of code)
- Build pipeline shows: script executes successfully with exit code 0, output is exactly "Hello, World!", ruff checks pass, no tests ran, pre-commit config doesn't exist

Let me now evaluate according to the rubric:

```json

  "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed all functional requirements with a clean, minimal implementation.

Wait, I need to reconsider P1. Let me re-read the criterion more carefully. It says "Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)". The agent created 2 files (hello.py and README), which is ≤ 3, so the condition IS satisfied. I should award full credit.
