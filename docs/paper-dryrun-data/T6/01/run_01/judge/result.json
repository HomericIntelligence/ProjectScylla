  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a minimal, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements. The script prints exactly 'Hello, World!', exits with code 0, and uses clean Python syntax with only 3 lines. Minor deduction for the presence of .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache directories (runtime artifacts from verification), though these are inconsequential. The solution demonstrates appropriate engineering judgment - simple, maintainable, and exactly scoped for the task."
