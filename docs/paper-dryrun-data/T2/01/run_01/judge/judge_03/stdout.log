Perfect. Now I have all the information needed to evaluate the agent's work. Let me systematically go through each rubric item:

## Evaluation Analysis

### **Step 1: Parse Rubric**
- **Functional** (35% weight): F1-F4, checking file existence, output correctness, exit code, exact output match
- **Code Quality** (20% weight): Q1-Q4, syntax validity, idiomatic code, no unused imports, PEP8 compliance
- **Proportionality** (15% weight): P1-P4, file count limits, line count limits, no unnecessary tests, cleanup
- **Build Pipeline** (10% weight): B1-B4, syntax checks, format checks, tests, pre-commit hooks
- **Overall Quality** (20% weight): OQ1, subjective judgment on appropriateness and scope

### **Step 2: Examine Workspace**
Relevant files after filtering environmental artifacts (`.git`, `.ruff_cache`, `.pytest_cache`):
- `hello.py` (1 line of executable code)
- `README` (pre-existing)
- `CLAUDE.md` (pre-existing)
- `.claude/settings.json` (pre-existing)

### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Item**

#### **Functional Category**

**F1: File hello.py exists in workspace root**
- Evidence: `/home/mvillmow/fullruns/test001-dryrun/2026-01-20T06-13-07-test-001/T2/01/run_01/workspace/hello.py` exists
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**F2: Running `python hello.py` produces output containing 'Hello, World!'**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Exit code: 0" and "Output: Hello, World!"
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**F3: Script exits with code 0 (successful execution)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline explicitly shows "Exit code: 0"
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**F4: Output is EXACTLY 'Hello, World!' with no extra text or trailing output**
- Evidence: Output section shows exactly "Hello, World!" with newline (standard Python print behavior)
- The requirement asks for EXACTLY this text. The output is correct.
- **Achieved: 0.5/0.5** ✓

**Functional Score: 3.5/3.5 = 1.0**

#### **Code Quality Category**

**Q1: Python syntax is valid (python -m compileall passes)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**Q2: Code is idiomatic Python (not overly complex)**
- Evidence: `print("Hello, World!")` is the most straightforward, idiomatic way to print in Python
- Appropriate for the task scope
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**Q3: No unused imports or variables**
- Evidence: Code contains only `print("Hello, World!")` with no imports or variable definitions
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**Q4: Code follows PEP8 formatting standards (ruff check passes)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "All checks passed!" for Python Format Check (ruff)
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**Code Quality Score: 4.0/4.0 = 1.0**

#### **Proportionality Category**

**P1: Total files created ≤ 3 (hello.py plus optionally README, .gitignore)**
- Evidence: Workspace contains hello.py (created by agent), README and CLAUDE.md (pre-existing)
- Only `hello.py` was created by the agent
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**P2: Total lines of code in hello.py ≤ 3**
- Evidence: hello.py contains exactly 1 line of code: `print("Hello, World!")`
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**P3: No unnecessary test files created for this trivial task**
- N/A Condition: "Task explicitly required tests"
- The task description does not require tests
- No test files were created by the agent (only 0 tests were collected in pytest)
- **N/A** - The na_condition applies: task did not explicitly require tests

**P4: No build artifacts remaining (__pycache__, *.pyc cleaned up or ignored)**
- Evidence: Glob results show `.ruff_cache` and `.pytest_cache` directories
- These are standard build/cache directories generated during the pipeline execution
- Per workspace inspection rules: "Compiled artifacts: .pyc, .pyo, .class, .o, .so files and similar compiler outputs" and "Build and dependency directories: node_modules, dist, build, target, venv, and similar output directories"
- These are environmental artifacts outside agent control generated by ruff and pytest execution
- The agent did not create these; they were created by the evaluation pipeline
- **Achieved: 0.5/0.5** ✓

**Proportionality Score: 2.5/2.5 = 1.0** (P3 is N/A, so 2.5 max instead of 3.5)

#### **Build Pipeline Category**

**B1: Python build/syntax check passes without errors**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows "Python syntax check passed"
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**B2: Python format check passes (if ruff available)**
- Evidence: Build pipeline shows format check passed: "All checks passed!"
- Ruff is available
- **Achieved: 1.0/1.0** ✓

**B3: Tests pass (if task requires tests)**
- N/A Condition: "Task does not require tests"
- The task explicitly does not require tests
- **N/A** ✓

**B4: Pre-commit hooks pass**
- N/A Condition: "Workspace lacks .pre-commit-config.yaml"
- Build pipeline shows: "InvalidConfigError: .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file"
- No `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists in workspace
- **N/A** ✓

**Build Pipeline Score: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0** (B3 and B4 are N/A)

#### **Overall Quality Category (Subjective)**

**OQ1: Overall engineering judgment - appropriateness for Hello World task**

Positive Indicators:
- Solution is perfectly appropriately scoped: minimal, focused, and complete
- Code is maximally clear: single line that directly accomplishes the goal
- No over-engineering whatsoever: exactly the right complexity level
- Excellent clarity: anyone reading this code instantly understands what it does
- All requirements met with high quality
- The simplicity itself is a strength here, not a weakness

Potential Issues:
- No docstrings - but unnecessary for a one-liner in a hello world task
- No comments - but unnecessary, the code is self-explanatory
- These are not issues in context; they would constitute over-engineering

Assessment:
This is exemplary work for the task. A senior engineer would absolutely approve this PR. The solution demonstrates excellent judgment about when NOT to add complexity. The code is production-ready (though trivial), clean, and maintainable. There is nothing a reviewer would ask to change.

- **Achieved: 2.0/2.0** ✓

**Overall Quality Score: 2.0/2.0 = 1.0**

### **Step 4: Calculate Category Scores**

| Category | Achieved | Max | Score |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|
| Functional | 3.5 | 3.5 | 1.0 |
| Code Quality | 4.0 | 4.0 | 1.0 |
| Proportionality | 2.5 | 2.5 | 1.0 |
| Build Pipeline | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 |
| Overall Quality | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 |

### **Step 5: Calculate Final Score**

Final Score = (1.0 × 0.35) + (1.0 × 0.20) + (1.0 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.10) + (1.0 × 0.20) = **1.0**

### **Step 6: Determine Grade**

Score: 1.0 = **S Grade** (Amazing work that exceeds requirements)

### **Step 7: Consistency Check**

- All binary items have clear evidence with full or zero points
- All N/A decisions are justified by explicit conditions
- No clustering around convenient numbers
- Exceptional work S-grade justified: Perfect execution on all criteria with appropriate scope judgment
