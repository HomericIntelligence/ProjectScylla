### Individual Judges

#### Judge 1: claude-opus-4-5-20251101

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 0.950 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully created a minimal, correct Hello World script that meets all functional requirements. The single-line implementation is appropriately scoped and idiomatic Python. Minor deduction for cache artifacts (.ruff_cache, .pytest_cache) remaining in workspace, though these are typically gitignored and were created by the build pipeline rather than the agent.

#### Judge 2: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 1.000 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | S |

**Reasoning:** The agent delivered a perfect Hello World implementation: exactly one line of code, correct output, clean workspace with no build artifacts. The solution demonstrates exceptional restraint and appropriateness for this trivial task, avoiding over-engineering while meeting all requirements. This is a textbook example of proportional engineering.

#### Judge 3: claude-haiku-4-5

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Score | 0.929 |
| Passed | ✅ |
| Grade | A |

**Reasoning:** The agent successfully created a perfectly minimal and idiomatic Hello World script that passes all functional requirements and code quality checks. The script produces exactly the required output with proper exit code. However, a deduction was applied for failing to clean up build artifacts (.pytest_cache and .ruff_cache directories) as explicitly required in the cleanup requirements of CLAUDE.md, preventing a perfect score.
