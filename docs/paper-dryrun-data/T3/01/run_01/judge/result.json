  "passed": true,
  "grade": "A",
  "reasoning": "The agent successfully created a simple, idiomatic hello.py script that meets all functional requirements. The script prints exactly 'Hello, World!' and exits with code 0. The implementation is appropriately minimal (3 lines) with no over-engineering. Minor deduction for .ruff_cache and .pytest_cache remaining in workspace, though these are build pipeline artifacts rather than agent-created files."
