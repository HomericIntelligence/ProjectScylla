Implement GitHub issue #603.

**Working Directory:** /home/mvillmow/ProjectScylla/.worktrees/issue-603
**Branch:** 603-auto-impl

**Issue Title:** Enable YAML and markdown linting in pre-commit hooks

**Issue Description:**

## Problem

Two pre-commit hooks are commented out in .pre-commit-config.yaml:

- YAML validation (yamllint)
- Markdown linting (markdownlint)

These provide valuable checks but are disabled, suggesting they may have issues that need resolution.

## Affected Files

- .pre-commit-config.yaml

## Current State

Commented-out hooks present but disabled:
\`\`\`yaml

# - repo: <https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint>

# hooks

# - id: yamllint

# - repo: <https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli>

# hooks

# - id: markdownlint

\`\`\`

## Investigation Steps

1. Uncomment hooks one at a time
2. Run against all files to discover failures:
   \`\`\`bash
   pre-commit run yamllint --all-files
   pre-commit run markdownlint --all-files
   \`\`\`
3. Categorize failures:
   - False positives → Configure to ignore
   - Legitimate issues → Fix or document exceptions
   - Performance issues → Adjust scope or settings

## Proposed Solution

**For yamllint:**
\`\`\`yaml

# .yamllint or embedded in .pre-commit-config.yaml

rules:
  line-length:
    max: 120
  indentation:
    spaces: 2
  comments:
    min-spaces-from-content: 1
\`\`\`

**For markdownlint:**
\`\`\`yaml

# .markdownlint.yaml

default: true
MD013: false  # Line length (if needed)
MD033: false  # Inline HTML (if needed)
MD041: false  # First line heading (if needed)
\`\`\`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] yamllint uncommented and passing on all YAML files
- [ ] markdownlint uncommented and passing on all Markdown files
- [ ] Configuration files added for any necessary exceptions
- [ ] Pre-commit runs both linters on changed files
- [ ] All existing YAML/Markdown files comply or have documented exceptions
- [ ] Commit: `feat(pre-commit): Enable YAML and markdown linting`

## Files to Check

\`\`\`bash

# Find all YAML files

find . -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" | grep -v ".pixi\|build\|.git"

# Find all Markdown files

find . -name "*.md" | grep -v "build\|.git"
\`\`\`

## Potential Issues

- YAML line length in config/models/*.yaml
- Markdown tables formatting
- Inline HTML in documentation
- Front matter in markdown files

## Estimated Effort

1 hour

## Priority

MEDIUM - Improves config and documentation quality but files are currently valid

---

**Implementation Context:**

- Run `gh issue view 603 --comments` to read the full plan and any comments
- Follow the project's Python conventions and type hint all function signatures

**Critical Requirements:**

1. Read the issue description and any existing plan carefully
2. Follow existing code patterns in scylla/
3. Write tests in tests/ using pytest
4. Run tests with: pixi run python -m pytest tests/ -v
5. Ensure all tests pass before finishing
6. Follow the code quality guidelines in CLAUDE.md

**Testing:**

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Use pytest fixtures and parametrize where appropriate

**Code Quality:**

- Type hint all function signatures
- Write docstrings for public APIs
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep solutions simple and focused

**File Handling:**

- DO NOT create backup files (.orig, .bak, .swp, etc.)
- DO NOT leave temporary or editor backup files
- Clean up any backup files before finishing
- Only stage actual implementation files

**Git Workflow:**
After implementation is complete and tests pass:

1. Create a git commit using the /commit-commands:commit skill
   - Use a descriptive commit message following conventional commits format
   - Include "Closes #603" in the commit message
2. Push the changes to origin
3. Create a pull request using the /commit-commands:commit-push-pr skill
   - Link the PR to this issue
   - Include a clear summary of changes and testing done

When you're done, the PR should be created and ready for review.
