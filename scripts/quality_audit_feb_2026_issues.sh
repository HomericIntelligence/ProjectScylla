## Objective
Clean up test suite by resolving skipped tests and removing .orig backup artifacts.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Investigate and resolve 4 skipped tests
- [ ] Remove all .orig artifacts from tests directory
- [ ] Update .gitignore to prevent .orig files from being committed

## Success Criteria
- Zero skipped tests in CI
- No .orig files in repository
- .gitignore prevents future .orig commits

## Priority
HIGH - Affects test reliability and repository cleanliness

## Estimated Effort
1-2 hours

## Verification
```bash
# Check for skipped tests
pixi run python -m pytest tests/ -v -rs

# Find .orig artifacts
find tests -name "*.orig" -type f

  name: Mypy Type Check Python
  entry: pixi run mypy scylla/ --strict
  language: system
  files: ^scylla/.*\.py$
  types: [python]
