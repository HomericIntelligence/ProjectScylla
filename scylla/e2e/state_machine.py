"""State machine for fine-grained run execution in E2E testing.

This module provides a state machine that advances a single run through
discrete, resumable states. Each transition saves a checkpoint, enabling
resume from any point after a crash or kill signal.

State flow for a single run (16 sequential states):
  PENDING
    -> DIR_STRUCTURE_CREATED  (create run_NN/, agent/, judge/ dirs)
    -> WORKTREE_CREATED        (git worktree add)
    -> SYMLINKS_APPLIED        (tier resources symlinked to workspace)
    -> CONFIG_COMMITTED        (CLAUDE.md, settings.json, git commit)
    -> BASELINE_CAPTURED       (build pipeline baseline, first run only)
    -> PROMPT_WRITTEN          (task_prompt.md written, thinking keyword injected)
    -> REPLAY_GENERATED        (adapter command built, replay.sh generated)
    -> AGENT_COMPLETE          (agent executed, outputs saved)
    -> DIFF_CAPTURED           (git diff captured, workspace state saved)
    -> JUDGE_PIPELINE_RUN      (build pipeline run on agent-modified workspace)
    -> JUDGE_PROMPT_BUILT      (full judge prompt assembled)
    -> JUDGE_COMPLETE          (judge executed, consensus, results saved)
    -> RUN_FINALIZED           (RunResult built, run_result.json saved)
    -> REPORT_WRITTEN          (report.md and report.json generated)
    -> CHECKPOINTED            (checkpoint saved)
    -> WORKTREE_CLEANED        (worktree removed)
