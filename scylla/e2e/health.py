"""Health monitoring for E2E experiments — zombie detection and heartbeat.

A "zombie" experiment is one where:
  - checkpoint.status == "running"
  - The PID in experiment.pid is dead (process no longer exists)
  - The last_heartbeat timestamp is stale (older than heartbeat_timeout_seconds)

Zombie experiments occur when a process is killed externally (OOM killer,
SIGKILL, cloud VM termination) without a clean shutdown path.

On resume, the zombie check auto-detects this condition and resets the
experiment state to "interrupted" so it can be safely resumed.

Usage:
    # In background thread during run
    heartbeat = HeartbeatThread(checkpoint, checkpoint_path, interval=30)
    heartbeat.start()
    ...
    heartbeat.stop()

    # On resume, before running
    if is_zombie(checkpoint, experiment_dir, timeout=120):
        checkpoint = reset_zombie_checkpoint(checkpoint, checkpoint_path)
