# ProjectScylla

ProjectScylla is a testing and optimization framework for agentic workflows, inspired by the mythic trials of Odysseus. In Homer’s Odyssey, Scylla represents one of the greatest challenges faced on the journey home — a monster that forced sailors to navigate perilous straits where every choice carried risk. In the same spirit, ProjectScylla provides a proving ground for AI agents, evaluating their ability to perform under constraints, balance trade-offs, and optimize outcomes when no path is perfect.

## Purpose

The goal of ProjectScylla is to measure, refine, and improve agentic systems. While ProjectOdyssey focuses on training and capability development, and ProjectKeystone establishes the communication layer for distributed agents, ProjectScylla ensures that agents are not only functional but resilient. It is the crucible where performance is tested, weaknesses are revealed, and strengths are sharpened.

## Core Concepts

- ⚖️ Trade-Off Evaluation: Agents are placed in scenarios where every decision has a cost, mirroring the dilemma of navigating between Scylla and Charybdis.
- 📊 Metrics & Benchmarks: Structured measurement of agent performance across adaptability, efficiency, and reliability.
- 🔄 Iterative Optimization: Continuous refinement through repeated trials, enabling agents to improve over time.
- 🧭 Resilience Testing: Assessing how agents respond to uncertainty, constraints, and unavoidable risks.

## Why Scylla?

Scylla embodies the essence of constrained optimization: unavoidable danger, sacrifice, and the need for wise navigation. By framing evaluation in this mythic context, ProjectScylla highlights the importance of judgment, foresight, and adaptability in agentic systems. Just as Odysseus had to choose the lesser evil to save his crew, agents must learn to optimize outcomes in environments where perfection is impossible.

## Ecosystem

- ProjectOdyssey → Training and capability development.
- ProjectKeystone → Communication and distributed agent coordination.
- ProjectScylla → Testing, measurement, and optimization under trial.
Together, these projects form a cohesive ecosystem for building, connecting, and refining agentic workflows
