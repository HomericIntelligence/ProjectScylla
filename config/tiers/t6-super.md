# T6: Super

Maximum capability configuration with ALL components enabled.

## Configuration

This tier enables every available component at maximum capacity:

### Prompts
- Full 1787-line CLAUDE.md with all 18 blocks

### Skills
- All 61 skills from all categories installed:
  - agent (5), cicd (7), documentation (4), github (10)
  - mojo (10), other (11), quality (5), workflow (5), worktree (4)

### Tools
- All built-in tools enabled
- All MCP servers configured:
  - filesystem, git, memory, fetch
  - sequential-thinking, time
  - github, postgres, playwright

### Agents
- All 44 agents registered:
  - L0 Chief Architect (1)
  - L1 Orchestrators (6)
  - L2 Design (4)
  - L3 Specialists (24)
  - L4 Senior Engineers (6)
  - L5 Junior Engineers (3)

## Purpose

This tier tests maximum capability vs. maximum overhead. It represents the theoretical upper bound
of the agent system's capabilities while also likely incurring the highest token and latency costs.

## Metrics Focus

- Absolute performance ceiling
- Maximum overhead measurement
- Comparison with optimized T5 Hybrid configurations
- Cost-of-Pass at maximum complexity

## Expected Characteristics

- Highest token usage per task
- Longest latency due to full agent hierarchy
- Maximum tool and skill availability
- Reference point for overhead calculations
